# Day 76 -- OpenTelemetry and Alerting

## Task
You have metrics (Prometheus) and logs (Loki). Today you add the third pillar -- traces -- using OpenTelemetry, the industry-standard framework for collecting telemetry data. Then you set up alerting so your system notifies you when something goes wrong, instead of you staring at dashboards all day.

By the end of today, your observability stack covers all three pillars and actively alerts on problems.

---

## Expected Output
- OpenTelemetry Collector running and exporting metrics to Prometheus
- OTLP traces sent to the collector and visible in debug output
- Prometheus alerting rules configured for critical conditions
- Grafana alert rules with notification contacts
- A markdown file: `day-76-otel-alerting.md`

---

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Understand OpenTelemetry
Research and write notes on:

1. **What is OpenTelemetry (OTEL)?**
   - A vendor-neutral, open-source framework for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces)
   - It is not a backend -- it collects and ships data to backends like Prometheus, Jaeger, Loki, Datadog

2. **What is the OTEL Collector?**
   - A standalone service that receives, processes, and exports telemetry
   - Three components in the pipeline:
     - **Receivers** -- accept data (OTLP, Prometheus, Jaeger formats)
     - **Processors** -- transform data (batching, filtering, sampling)
     - **Exporters** -- send data to backends (Prometheus, debug console, Jaeger)

3. **What is OTLP?**
   - OpenTelemetry Protocol -- the standard wire format for sending telemetry
   - Supports gRPC (port 4317) and HTTP (port 4318)

4. **What are distributed traces?**
   - A trace tracks a single request as it travels through multiple services
   - Each step in the trace is called a **span**
   - Spans have: trace ID, span ID, parent span ID, start time, duration, attributes
   - Example: User request -> API Gateway (span 1) -> Auth Service (span 2) -> Database (span 3)

### Task 2: Add the OpenTelemetry Collector
Create the collector configuration:

```bash
mkdir -p otel-collector
```

Create `otel-collector/otel-collector-config.yml`:
```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889"
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [prometheus]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
```

**What this config does:**
- **Receivers:** Accepts OTLP data via gRPC (4317) and HTTP (4318)
- **Processors:** Batches data before exporting (reduces overhead)
- **Exporters:**
  - Metrics go to a Prometheus-compatible endpoint on port 8889 (Prometheus scrapes this)
  - Traces and logs go to debug output (console) -- in production you would send these to Jaeger or Tempo

Add the collector to your `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest
    container_name: otel-collector
    ports:
      - "4317:4317"   # OTLP gRPC
      - "4318:4318"   # OTLP HTTP
      - "8889:8889"   # Prometheus exporter
    volumes:
      - ./otel-collector/otel-collector-config.yml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Add the OTEL Collector as a Prometheus scrape target in `prometheus.yml`:
```yaml
  - job_name: "otel-collector"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["otel-collector:8889"]
```

Restart everything:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Verify the collector is running:
```bash
docker logs otel-collector 2>&1 | tail -5
```

Check Prometheus Targets -- you should now see `otel-collector` as UP.

---

### Task 3: Send Test Traces to the Collector
Send a sample OTLP trace using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4318/v1/traces \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resourceSpans": [{
      "resource": {
        "attributes": [{
          "key": "service.name",
          "value": { "stringValue": "my-test-service" }
        }]
      },
      "scopeSpans": [{
        "spans": [{
          "traceId": "5b8efff798038103d269b633813fc60c",
          "spanId": "eee19b7ec3c1b174",
          "name": "test-span",
          "kind": 1,
          "startTimeUnixNano": "1544712660000000000",
          "endTimeUnixNano": "1544712661000000000",
          "attributes": [{
            "key": "http.method",
            "value": { "stringValue": "GET" }
          },
          {
            "key": "http.status_code",
            "value": { "intValue": "200" }
          }]
        }]
      }]
    }]
  }'
```

Check the collector debug output to see the trace:
```bash
docker logs otel-collector 2>&1 | grep -A 10 "test-span"
```

You should see the span details printed to the console. In a production setup, you would send these to a trace backend like Jaeger or Grafana Tempo for storage and visualization.

**Send OTLP metrics too:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resourceMetrics": [{
      "resource": {
        "attributes": [{
          "key": "service.name",
          "value": { "stringValue": "my-test-service" }
        }]
      },
      "scopeMetrics": [{
        "metrics": [{
          "name": "test_requests_total",
          "sum": {
            "dataPoints": [{
              "asInt": "42",
              "startTimeUnixNano": "1544712660000000000",
              "timeUnixNano": "1544712661000000000"
            }],
            "aggregationTemporality": 2,
            "isMonotonic": true
          }
        }]
      }]
    }]
  }'
```

Now query it in Prometheus:
```promql
test_requests_total
```

The metric traveled: your curl command -> OTEL Collector (OTLP receiver) -> Prometheus exporter -> Prometheus scraped it. This is how OTEL bridges different telemetry formats.

### Task 4: Set Up Prometheus Alerting Rules
Alerts notify you when something is wrong. Prometheus evaluates alerting rules and fires alerts when conditions are met.

Create an alerting rules file `alert-rules.yml`:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: system-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: 100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100) > 80
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU usage detected"
          description: "CPU usage has been above 80% for more than 2 minutes. Current value: {{ $value }}%"

      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: (1 - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) * 100 > 85
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High memory usage detected"
          description: "Memory usage is above 85%. Current value: {{ $value }}%"

      - alert: ContainerDown
        expr: absent(container_last_seen{name="notes-app"})
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Container is down"
          description: "The notes-app container has not been seen for over 1 minute"

      - alert: TargetDown
        expr: up == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Scrape target is down"
          description: "{{ $labels.job }} target {{ $labels.instance }} is unreachable"

      - alert: HighDiskUsage
        expr: (1 - node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint="/"}) * 100 > 90
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Disk space running low"
          description: "Root filesystem usage is above 90%. Current value: {{ $value }}%"
```

**What each alert does:**
- `expr` -- the PromQL condition that triggers the alert
- `for` -- how long the condition must be true before firing (avoids flapping)
- `labels` -- metadata for routing (severity: warning vs critical)
- `annotations` -- human-readable description

Update `prometheus.yml` to load the rules:
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  - /etc/prometheus/alert-rules.yml

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]

  - job_name: "node-exporter"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["node-exporter:9100"]

  - job_name: "cadvisor"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["cadvisor:8080"]

  - job_name: "otel-collector"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["otel-collector:8889"]
```

Mount the rules file in `docker-compose.yml` under the Prometheus service:
```yaml
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    container_name: prometheus
    ports:
